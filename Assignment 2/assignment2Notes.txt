Instructions
Create a HTML form that allows a user to enter a school mark/grade. After pressing submit, use PHP to execute the following tasks:
If no value is entered, print an error message.
If the value is numeric, use a nested if statement to display the corresponding letter Grade according to the following:
A:  85-100
B:  75-84.99
C:  60-74.99
F:  0-59.99.
If the mark is not numeric, use a switch statement to display the mark range the grade corresponds to (see above table).


Create a HTML form that allows a user to choose a pizza size and a number of toppings. Use a dropdown field for size (extra-large, large, medium, and small) and a checkbox field for each topping (pepperoni, cheese, olive, pineapple, and ham). Retrieve the user's selections and calculate their overall price based on the following criteria:
A small pizza is $9.00
A medium pizza is $12.50
A large pizza is $15.00
An extra large pizza is $17.50
Each topping adds $1.00 to the total cost of the order (except cheese is free).
Display the size and toppings ordered along with the total cost of the order.
